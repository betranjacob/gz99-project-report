Legacy web servers follow a monolithic design which once compromized, lets
sensitive data that reside in plaintext form in memory, exposed to an
adversary.  We proposed a design for web servers that are deployed on the cloud
environment, under the assumption that the cloud provider is malicious and/or
the undelying operating system is untrusted. Our design utilizes \Intel~SGX to
provide isolation guarantees for the server's private key for both ciphers that
lack or offer forward secrecy support. It splits legacy monolithic web server
designs into a trusted and an untrusted component, while its trusted component
comprises a minimal TCB instead of an entire application. We augmented the
baseline design to further secure the SSL/TLS session keys, hardening the
attack environment for an adversary that wishes to decrypt recorded sessions at
its leisure. We developed a prototype implementation using NGINX and LibreSSL
and evaluated the overhead \Intel~SGX introduces to the web server's end-to-end
performance. The results verify our initial hypothesis and show that the
overhead is large, which may discourage people from using our system in
production environments under heavy workloads.

We thank our supervisor Professor B. Karp for our enlightening discussions
during the course of this project and his insightful feedback that helped us
improve this report.
