We conducted this analysis to uncover the impact of our design and SGX
instructions on end-to-end web server performance. To this end, we
utilised the performance model, while varying the number of busywait
cycles, to approximate the overhead of SGX instructions. Additionally,
we evaluated the effect of response size on end-to-end performance by
varying the size of the response to a client's request.
