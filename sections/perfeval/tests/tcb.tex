\label{sec:tcb-analysis}
we would like to know how does the tcb look like after our partitioning.

\subsubsection*{Test Setup}
we run the \enclaveprogram under callgrind 
gather the functions called and manually copy over
for the modifications we run cloc, we do not distinguish between the different versions

\subsubsection*{Results}
we modified this much and added this much
we use this many functins from this many files
this is the table

\subsubsection*{Analysis of Results}
tcb is much smaller
we might missed some paths since its dynamic analysis
