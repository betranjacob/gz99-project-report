We wanted to evaluate the performance overhead introduced by: (1) our design
and (2) executing within an SGX enclave. However, we developed our prototype
using OpenSGX which, as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:background}, is an
emulator for the SGX instruction set and relies on QEMU to execute the trusted
code. Consequently, we could not evaluate the prototype's performance by
simply executing it and capturing performance measures.

The remainder of this section describes the performance model we employed to
circumvent the lack of real SGX hardware, a set of microbenchmarks developed
to measure:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The performance impact, due to accessing main memory, introduced by
    the SGX memory encryption engine.
  \item The number of CPU instructions added by our design to the
    stock implementation of NGINX + LibreSSL.
  \item The size of the TCB compared to the stock implementation.
\end{enumerate}
and the evaluation of end-to-end performance.
