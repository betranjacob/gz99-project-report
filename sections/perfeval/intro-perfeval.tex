We wanted to evaluate the performance overhead introduced by: (1) our
design (2) executing within an SGX enclave. However, we developed our
prototype using OpenSGX which, as detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:background}, is an emulator for the SGX instruction
set and relies on QEMU to execute the trusted code. Consequently, we
could not evaluate the prototype's performance by executing it and
capturing performance measures.

The remainder of this section describes a set of microbenchmarks
developed to measure:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The number of CPU instructions added by our design to the
    stock implementation of NGINX + LibreSSL.
  \item The performance impact introduced by the memory encryption
    engine in accessing main memory. Since we do not have access to SGX
    hardware, we used Last Level Cache (LLC) miss rates as a proxy for estimating the
    overhead.    
\end{enumerate}
and a performance model, similar to the one used by~\cite{Baumann14},
to approximate end-to-end performance.
