\subsection{Threat model} % reference this to the developer reference
We consider a threat model similar to the one presented in Haven []. Our TCB
includes a correctly implemented and SGX enabled CPU and all instructions
executing and data resident within an enclave. Therefore, we assume an attacker
cannot access the SGX processor key provisioned by Intel itself, which is used
to generate subsequent cryptographic keys that preserve the confidentiality,
integrity and authenticity of an enclave.

An adversary can take full control of everything beyond the TCB. That is, we
assume all software executing on the platform (outside of the enclave), the
underlying operating system, the hypervisor, all firmware and the BIOS are
potentially compromized. Side-channel attacks that originate from other sources
such as CPU cache timing information (L1, L2, L3), power consumption or other
entropy source are considered as out of scope of this work. Finally, we assume
an attacker may act as man-in-the-middle to eavesdrop active sessions and,
as further analyzed in the Limitations section, launch a denial-of-service
attack, though without compromizing any secret isolation guarantees of our
design.
