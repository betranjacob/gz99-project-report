With the recent surge in privacy concerns, employing SSL/TLS to secure communications in the middle of the network has become common place. 
SSL/TLS offers guarantees of confidentiality and integrity provided that a private key's secrecy is maintained. Yet, SSL/TLS was designed 
assuming that its user trusts the hardware and OS of the machine on which the key is held. 

While this assumption is perfectly valid in the case where a person is running an SSL/TLS enabled service on their own machines, many web
applications are now hosted by third party cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Digital Ocean \&c. Moreover, to offer 
SSL/TLS, the private key must also be stored with the web application on these service providers' machines. This implies that a server administrator 
using the aforementioned services is trusting the cloud-provider, including any personnel with physical/administrative access to the machines, and the underlying OS
to maintain the secrecy of the sensitive key material. Such a wide trust surface makes it difficult to maintain the privacy of critical
secrets.

Consider a case where the cloud provider is not malicious; a vulnerability within their platform could lead to leaking the private key
if exploited by an adversary. Moreover, if the cloud provider is indeed malicious they could simply read your private key from the hard disk if stored 
unencrypted, or mount some form of memory sniffing attack to read the key from the web server's memory since data in RAM is unencrypted. A compromised private 
key allows an adversary to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Decrypt past, stored, communication between the web server and a client (assuming a cipher that does not provide perfect forward secrecy is in use)
	\item Decrypt any ongoing communication between the web server and a client
	\item Masquerade as the server and fool a client into disclosing sensitive information such as passwords
\end{itemize}
In all cases, a compromised key voids the confidentially and integrity guarantees of SSL/TLS. 

The goal of this project is to secure the private key in the face of:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An adversary who exploits the server application 
	\item A malicious cloud provider 
	\item An adversary with an exploit for the underlying operating system
\end{enumerate} 
The first point has been extensively addressed in previous works including Wedge and OKWS; % need to reference these/adjust this sentence
the latter two have been discussed in recent works such as Haven. 						   % could link to previous works here...
