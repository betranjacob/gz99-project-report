With the recent surge in privacy concerns, employing SSL/TLS to secure
communications in the middle of the network has become common
place. SSL/TLS offers guarantees of confidentiality and integrity,
provided that a private key's secrecy is maintained. Yet, SSL/TLS was
designed assuming that its user trusts the hardware and OS of the
machine on which the key is held.
 
While this assumption is perfectly valid in the case where a person is
running an SSL/TLS-enabled service on their own machines, many web
applications are now hosted by third party cloud service providers
such as Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Digital Ocean \&c. Moreover, to
offer SSL/TLS, the private key must also be stored with the web
application on these service providers' machines. This implies that a
server administrator using the aforementioned services is trusting the
cloud-provider, including any personnel with physical/administrative
access to the machines, and the underlying OS to maintain the secrecy
of the sensitive key material. Such a wide trust surface makes it
difficult to maintain the privacy of critical secrets.

% why 'assuming the key is not encrypted" is valid -> server program needs access to the private key for correct o[eration, i.e. hanling the handshake

Consider a case where the cloud provider is not malicious; a
vulnerability within their platform could lead to leaking the private
key if exploited by an adversary. Moreover, if the cloud provider is
indeed malicious, they could simply read your private key from the hard
disk, assuming the key is not encrypted, or mount some form of memory
sniffing attack to read the key from the web server's memory since
data in RAM is not encrypted. A compromised private key allows an
adversary to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decrypt past, stored communication between the web server and a
    client (assuming a cipher that does not provide perfect forward
    secrecy is in use)
  \item Decrypt any ongoing communication between the web server and a
    client
  \item Masquerade as the server and fool a client into disclosing
    sensitive information such as passwords
\end{itemize}
In all cases, a compromised key voids the confidentially and integrity
guarantees of SSL/TLS.

Clearly, implicitly trusting a cloud-proivder and the OS with
sensitive key material poses a considerable security risk. Yet, this
assumption of trust is usually the case when server administrators
deploy web applications via cloud based services. Our project aims to
break this assumption by refactoring legacy web servers to secure the
long term private key in the face of: (1) An adversary who is capable
of exploiting the server application, (2) a malicious cloud provider,
and (3) an adversary with an exploit for the underlying operating
system. We utilise the principle of least privilege and along with a
recently released technology from \Intel~called Software Guard
Extensions, both of which are described in
Section~\ref{sec:background}, in designing our system.

The remainder of this report is divided as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:background} provides a detailed overview of previous
solutions to the problem outlined here, and technologies underlying
our project, Section~\ref{sec:design} discusses the design of the
system that we implemented to meet the above-stated goals,
Section~\ref{sec:implementation} highlights a few implementation
considerations in realising the system that we designed,
Section~\ref{sec:perfeval} presents the evaluation we have conducted
of the system, Section~\ref{sec:projectmgmt} details the managerial
aspects of this project, and, finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
offers areas where this project could be improved, and concludes this
report.
