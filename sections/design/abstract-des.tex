By utilizing the above-detailed remote-attestation process, we can
provision the trusted component of the remote server application with
an SSL private key while making it extremely difficult for even
\textit{privileged} processes running on the cloud provider to access
the key. This is a stark contrast to current schemes wherein the
private key is merely shipped as part of the server application to the
cloud provider.
