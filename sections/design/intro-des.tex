% TODO: ALL TEXT IN THIS SECTION IS WIP
Given the background and threat model detailed above, we may now
discuss the design of our system. We first describe how the system is
partitioned in a cipher agnostic manner. Then, we expand upon the
generic design, illustrating how the system handles: (1) Ciphers that
do not offer forward secrecy (2) Ciphers that offer forward secrecy.

% FIXME: I believe here we should introduce the split on the designs
% for private and session key isolation, there is more content at the
% end of this section on this which should be moved here as well.

None of our designs modify the SSL handshake itself, though we carefully
compartmentalize the protocol's execution in trusted and untrusted
components. The interface for both kind of ciphers is split into two
versions, one where only the private key of the server is protected
and one where both the private and the session keys are protected by
the enclave.
