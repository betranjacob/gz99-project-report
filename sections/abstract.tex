  Web Servers are now often deployed in the cloud environment. To
  secure communications in the middle of the network between clients and web servers, 
  the Internet community has come to rely on the SSL/TLS protocol which requires a strong
  secret (private key) to be stored with the server. However, the server administrator, in this
  model, is forced to trust the cloud provider to not disclose their private key. We propose a
  modification to legacy web servers and cryptographic libraries which secures
  the sensitive key material in the face a malicious provider or a compromised operating system 
  without the need to trust the cloud provider and/or operating system.
