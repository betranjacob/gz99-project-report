During the early phase of project planning there were no sufficient SGX
development platforms available, hence we had to succumb to an SGX emulator. We
left as future work, the porting of the entire framework on a platform with real SGX
hardware running on a machine in the cloud. This will help us evaluate our
design in a real production environment with optimal system performance. In
particular, with an SGX enabled platform (with multi-core support), enclaves
can distribute the workload generated from different NGINX worker processes to
separate threads. Consequently a large number of client requests can be
honoured concurrently.

We also deferred the support for SSL SessionTickets in the current
implementation. We considered incorporating this feature in the future, so that the
server does not need to cache any SSL session information except from the
ticket's keys. This will significantly reduce the memory overhead generated to
support larger number of clients within an enclave. Also, having observed the
evaluation results, we identified certain performance optimisations we could do
to reduce the number of context switches. In the interest of time, we left
such improvements in our implementation as future work.
