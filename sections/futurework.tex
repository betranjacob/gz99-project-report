\section{Future Work}
During the early phase of project planning there were no sufficient SGX
development platforms available, hence we had to succumb to an SGX emulator. We
leave as future work porting the entire framework on a platform with real SGX
hardware running on a machine in the cloud. This will help us evaluate our
design in a real production environment with optimal system performance. In
particular, with an SGX enabled platform (with multi-core support), enclaves
can distribute the workload generated from different NGINX worker processes to
separate threads. Consequently a large number of client requests can be
honoured concurrently.

In the interest of time, we also deferred the support for SSL SessionTickets in
the current implementation. We consider incorporating this feature in the
future, so the server does not have to cache any SSL session information except
from the ticket's keys. This will significantly reduce the memory overhead
generated to support larger number of clients within an enclave.
