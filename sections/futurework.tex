\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}
During the early phase of project planning there were no sufficient SGX
development platforms available, hence we had to succumb to an SGX emulator. We
plan to port the entire framework on a platform with real SGX hardware support
running on a machine in the cloud. This will help us validate a real world
scenario with optimal system performance. In particular with a (multi-core) SGX
enabled platform, enclaves can distribute the workload generated from different
NGINX worker processes to separate threads. Consequently a large number of
client requests can be honoured concurrently.

In the interest of time, we also deferred the support for SSL SessionTickets in
the current implementation. We consider incorporating this feature in the
future, so the server doesn't have to cache any SSL session information except
from the ticket's keys. This will significantly reduce the memory overhead
generated to support larger number of clients within an enclave.
