\textbf{Future Work}
\subsection{Future Work}

During the early phase of project planning there were no sufficient SGX development platforms available, hence we had to succumb to a SGX emulator. In the future, we are planning  to port the entire framework on a real SGX supported platform running on a cloud machine. This will help us validate a real world scenario with optimal system performance. In particular with a SGX enabled ( with multicore ) platform, enclaves can distribute the workload generated from different NGINX worker processes to separate threads. Consequently a large number of client requests can be honoured concurrently. 

In the interest of time, we also deferred the support for SSL session tickets in the current implementation. We will  incorporate this feature in the future, so the server doesnâ€™t have to cache any SSL session information. This will significantly reduce the memory overhead generated to support larger number of clients.
